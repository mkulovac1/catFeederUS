<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Catfeeder is an application that helps when we are feeding cats. It is an embedded application that was implemented on the Raspberry Pi Pico development system with additional components such as a display, 
  keyboard and motor. With the help of the keyboard, we enter the pin used for identity verification. 
  If the pin is correct, the opening in the box opens with the help of a servo motor and food falls out of food container into cat bowl. 
  The entire procedure can be followed on the display, which shows the pin entry and whether or not we have successfully entered the given pin.
